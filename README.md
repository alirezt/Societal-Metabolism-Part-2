# Societal-Metabolism-Part-2

The term ecosystem services (ESs) have been in academic fashion for about 20 years in a wide variety of disciplines. It intrigue both academics and policymakers to use this phrase in order to highlight the significance of nature (mainly in biophysical term) in people livelihoods and welfare. Many tools and protocols have been proposed to measure the quantity and quality of local and global ESs, and their usage in real-world decision-making process is getting more momentum. Data that import to these tools are mainly geospatial and physical maps and dataset, and their output are in the same format. By overlaying these output by socio-economic data, decisionmakers can visually understand where are the hotspot for preservation and protection.
