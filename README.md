# Societal-Metabolism-Part-2

The term ecosystem services (ESs) have been in academic fashion for about 20 years in a wide variety of disciplines. It intrigue both academics and policymakers to use this phrase in order to highlight the significance of nature (mainly in biophysical term) in people livelihoods and welfare. Many tools and protocols have been proposed to measure the quantity and quality of local and global ESs, and their usage in real-world decision-making process is getting more momentum. Data that import to these tools are mainly geospatial and physical maps and dataset, and their output are in the same format. By overlaying these output by socio-economic data, decisionmakers can visually understand where are the hotspot for preservation and protection. 

Societal metabolism (SM) has almost the same age of ESs concept, and considered as a branch in industrial ecology. Unlike ESs, in SM we are mostly interested in the socio-economic dynamics of a human community (technosphere) rather then the nature (biosphere). In SM, societies are mainly represented by their metabolic identities which are considered as proxies for their developmental trajectories. That is, the variability of activities in economic and household sections, inputs needed for these activities, goal (outputs) of these activities, and finally waste. A normal practice in SM is to give a hierarchical representation of the system (a human society in our case) based on human time allocation (hours activities HA) and then measure the inputs and outputs of every level in this metabolic hierarchy. These inputs and outputs are in both economic and biophysical term. For instance, how much energy, water, minerals and financial budget are needed for a one-hour activity in a branch of industrial sector of a country?. 

Representing societies based on their human time activity investments and variability implicitly addresses the most important question in socio-economic system: what is the rationale behind this particular labor market segmentation (LMS)? Is this particular LMS sustainable? Is this based on social and ecological context of the region? Is this LMS based on equal distribution of socio-ecological benefits? These kind of questions trying to address the pre-analytical phase of any logistic decision making. Because, when ever a new job (or in metabolism term HA investments) is created, then certain amount of social, economic and ecological sources and sinks are needed in order to guarantee the sustainability and longevity of this particular activity. Therefore, it is essential to understand how ESs support employments and livelihoods in order to find the right answers to those questions. This is what I try to explore in my research. I will characterize societies based on their technosphere and biosphere features using  i) geospatial and biophysical analysis in ESs tools, and ii) constructed intensive variables (metabolic proxies) from SM analysis which is based on input-output (I-O) models. After this contextualized characterization I use advanced statistical and computer analysis (machine learning) in order to explore the relationship between independent (exploratory) variables and the dependent (response) variable. The result would clarify if there is a meaningful relationship between these heterogenous variables (descriptive analytics), and also could serve as prediction tool for future (predicative analytics) scenarios.
